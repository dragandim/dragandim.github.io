During my time at Increase, I primarily worked with Oracle's Eloqua platform, building custom applications and data integrations in the AWS cloud.

One of the more notable projects was the development of the Event App â€” a solution designed to automate and manage event workflows within Eloqua. The app dynamically created campaign assets such as emails, landing pages, registration forms, and custom data objects. It supported the full event lifecycle, including invitation, registration, and real-time participation tracking.
