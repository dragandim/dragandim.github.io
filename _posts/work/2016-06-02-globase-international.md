At Globase, I led a development team of five engineers and helped support a client portfolio of over 100 companies, including Mercedes-Benz, Bang & Olufsen, 3M, Grundfos, DFDS, and Cognito. The core product was a SaaS Email Marketing Automation platform, complemented by a suite of custom solutions, microsites, and landing pages.

My responsibilities included:

* Leading the development team using Agile SCRUM practices
* Maintaining and evolving internal platforms and client-specific solutions
* Participating in pre-sales and requirements specification
* Managing physical server infrastructure hosted in QSC (Germany)
* Serving as a member of the company’s management group
* Overseeing the migration of clients from the legacy V1 platform to the modernized V2

This was a dynamic period marked by technical transformation and cultural shifts, as Globase transitioned from Ad Pepper Media ownership to MailUp (Growens).
