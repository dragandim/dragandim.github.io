At Norlid, many clients relied on Oracle Eloqua as their marketing automation platform, and I was responsible for developing a range of custom solutions and integrations tailored to their business needs. These often involved building logic around Eloqua’s Contact, Asset, and Campaign systems to support dynamic workflows and extend core functionality.

A large part of my work focused on integrating third-party data sources — importing Contacts and related information, and exporting activity data such as email clicks, web visits, and push responses.

Over time, this experience led to the development of a set of standardized SaaS solutions, installable across multiple Eloqua instances. In my additional role as Head of Product, I was responsible for transforming bespoke solutions into reusable software products, deployed and managed entirely on AWS infrastructure.

Beyond Eloqua work, I also developed the backend and mobile app for Få tiden tilbage, a six-month-long project focused on productivity and time tracking in the context of railway maintenance and service delays.
