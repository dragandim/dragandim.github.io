This integration project was about making Eloqua send push messages using [Airship](https://www.airship.com/). The integration was covering the following use cases:
* Send push message from campaign canvas (including scheduled and in-app)
* Send push message from a segment (batch)
* Send push message on form post
* Import devices to Eloqua
* Collect activity response

post will show you how the content will look like in the post pages and how the headlines, quotes and quotes will be represented. Jekyll is mainly used to write simple markdown and after that it renders out a static pages, so you need to know the basics of writing markdown for that.
For more information about writing markdown you can checkout the following markdown cheatsheets:
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
