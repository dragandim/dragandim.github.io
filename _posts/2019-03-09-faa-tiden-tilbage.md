"Få tiden tilbage" was an interesting projects that took almost 6 month to complete. The client was a public transpaoration copmany (DSB) and the concept was focusing on bringing back value
 to the passangeres who experince dealays, due to the maintenance work done on the railways. The first release of the application was dealing with the journeys, where a passenger was to able to check in
 on the begining of the journey, and checkout on the destination, earning a certain amount of minutes. Every journey route had a defined award, and every journey was adding to the total of the time saved. 
 
The second release of the application was dealing with the in-app ticket purchase based on the time (points) saved.
