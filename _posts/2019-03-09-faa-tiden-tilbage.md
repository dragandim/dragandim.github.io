# “Få tiden tilbage”

It was the one of the most interesting project I have done up to date. The customer was the public transportation company DSB who had a challenge when having maintenance work done on the railways.
The idea was to give value back to the passengers who were affected by delays. We created a mobile application which allowed passengers to check in and out at predefined set of stations. Every route would give a certain amount of time (minutes) saved on users account.  Accumulated time could then be used to purchase in app tickets. Tickets could then be scanned in trains by ticket controllers. 

With this project Norlid won the Danish Digital Award in the category “Digital Activation” (https://danishdigitalaward.dk/projekt/faa-tiden-tilbage-3/)  (DSB)
