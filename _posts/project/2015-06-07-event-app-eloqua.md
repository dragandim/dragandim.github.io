The primary goal of this project was to build an application that simplifies and streamlines event management in Oracle Eloqua. Creating event flows manually in Eloqua is often repetitive and time-consuming. This application was designed to automate that process â€” enabling marketers to set up event logic and required assets with minimal manual effort.

During the event creation process, the application automatically generates and configures Eloqua assets such as Segments, Emails, Forms, Landing Pages, Campaigns, and Custom Data Objects (CDOs). These assets are then integrated into the Eloqua campaign canvas to support the full event lifecycle, including invitations, registrations, cancellations, and waiting list handling.

Once a campaign is activated, Contacts in the segment receive an invitation email. By clicking the registration link, they enter the event flow. Participant status (e.g. registered, attended, unregistered, waiting) can be updated through the application and is tracked via CDOs using Eloqua processing steps.

To maintain consistent branding and reduce setup time, the application supports reusable Asset Templates for emails and landing pages. This enables high levels of customization and reusability across events.
