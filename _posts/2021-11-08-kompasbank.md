This is was first role in a fintech industry. I worked on an in house system developed for Lead Generation. It was a tool used by the sales team to find the Danish companies with solid economy who would be suitable candidatds for credit approvals. The input from the sales time was fed into the learning model wich analysed anual reports, probability of distress and other financial information relevant in minimizing risks. 

Another interesting part of my journey at kompasbank was being part of credit automation project. The objective was to process batches of credit applications through KYC, AML and PEP checks.

The software was developed using Typescript for both front end, back end and AWS cloud resource provisioning.
