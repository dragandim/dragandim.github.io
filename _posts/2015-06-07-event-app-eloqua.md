# About
Event App was Initially a request from Bonava to create functionality for handling events in Eloqua.  It included asset management such as registration forms, processing steps, landing pages,  emails and custom data object connecting all assets in a campaign canvas.  Application can handle participant attendance, different flows (invitation, registration, unregistration) and waiting list for booked events. (Bonava)
