Most of my time at Increase I spent working with Oracles's marketing automation platform Eloqua. I was building apps and data integrations in the AWS cloud. One of the more interesting project during that time, was the development of the Event App. This application was designed to handle the event flow by creating many assets (Email, Landing Page, Registration Form, Custom Data Object etc) on a campaign canvas in Eloqua, which can handle the invitation, registration and keep track of the participation status.
