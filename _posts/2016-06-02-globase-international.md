# Project and challenges
One of the biggest and most challenging projects during my time at Globase was the migration of the 2 cabinets from one hosting location to another at QSC. This meant that most of the underlying services which powered platforms had to be restarted and reconfigured, from database servers, load balancers, web servers, network switches, etc.

# Roles
* Managing development team (Agile SCRUM)
* Maintaining in house platforms and custom solutions
* Involved in pre-sales and requirement specification
* Maintaining 6 hardware cabinets in QSC Germany
* Part of the management team

    
Another big undertaking was the attempt to migrate V2 platform from QSC  to a new cloud setup at Mailup hosting center in Cremona. Even though we could not complete the migration due to the high level of complexity and unforeseeable issues, we were able to implement continuous deployment on the existing setup, since the V2 platform was fully virtualized in a development environment.
