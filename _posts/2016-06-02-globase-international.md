My second time at Globase, although very different role in terms of responsibities and a new company owner (Mailup Group).
Like with the most company acquisitions, the change of ownerwhip and culture can have a strong impact on orgamisations. 
Appart from the structural and strategical changes, the company had to go through a discovery process in terms of technology
and infrastructure.

One of the biggest and most challenging projects during my time at Globase was the migration of hardware. We needed to change location
withing the same hosting provider but which powered all the services neccessary for the operation of the 
from one hosting location to another at QSC. This meant that most of the underlying services which powered 
platforms had to be restarted and reconfigured, from database servers, load balancers, web servers.

List of responsibilities
* Managing development team (Agile SCRUM)
* Maintaining in house platforms and custom solutions
* Pre-sales and requirement specification
* Maintaining hardware in QSC 
* Management group

Another big undertaking was the migrattion of the V2 platform from QSC to a new cloud setup at Mailup hosting center in Cremona. 
Even though we could not complete the migration due to the high level of complexity and unforeseeable issues, we were able to implement 
continuous deployment on the existing setup, since the V2 platform was fully virtualized in a development environment.
