At Globase, I was responslible for a development team of 5 employees. The company had a client portfolio of about 100 companies, among which where: Mercedes - Benz , Bang & Olufsen, 3M, Grundfos, DFDS, Cognito and others. Our SaaS product was an Email Marketing Automation platform with an eco system of custom solutions, microsites and landing pages.

List of responsibilities:
* Managing development team (Agile SCRUM)
* Maintaining in house platforms and custom solutions
* Pre-sales and requirement specification
* Maintaining server racks in QSC (Germany)
* Being part of the Management group
* Migrating clients from V1 to V2 platform

It was an exciting time of transition and cultural changes due to the fact that Globase changed the ownership, from Ad Pepper Media to Mailup (Growens).
