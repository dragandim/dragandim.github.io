Since many of the Norlid's clients use Eloqua as a marketing automation platform, I was working on developing custom solutions and integrations.
Most of the solutions whould typicaly involve a specific business logic added on top of Eloqua, which would handle Contacts, Email Content or manage Assets
in campaign canvas. Integrations where concerning primarily with importing Contacts and related data from different sources, and exporting data on Contact activities
such as email clicks, web visits, push response etc. 

As a result of many years of developing software arround Eloqua, a series of products have emerged as standard packages. These SaaS type solutions where designed to be installed
across instances and serve the needs of multiple clients. With my second role as a 'Head of product', I had a responsibility to create standard software based on the experiences from 
custom solutions. All the applications have been developed and hosted on AWS cloud.

Besides building software for Eloqua, I had an opportunity to develop a backend and mobile application for "FÃ¥ tiden tilbage" project which took six months to complete.
