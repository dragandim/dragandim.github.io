# Dragan Dimitrijevic
_Software Engineer_

I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on building scalable, backend-heavy web applications - especially those involving cloud infrastructure, APIs, and developer tools.

Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve worked across startups and enterprise clients, delivering custom solutions and integrations - including advanced work with marketing automation platforms like Oracle Eloqua. My background combines deep technical skill with a product-focused mindset.

Key strengths:
- Full ownership of projects from idea to deployment
- Clean code, clear architecture, and maintainable design
- Familiarity with real-world SaaS delivery, authentication flows, and CI/CD automation
